# THE DI BUS IS HAVING ITS NEXT STEP AT THE POSTGARAGE

The homebase of DI is moving from our beloved DIE GELBE FABRRIK to the newly
crreated POSTGARAGE at the CAMPUS V. Our friends at GO BIG just released their
styleguide for the branding including its dynamic logo rules.
We love dynamic logos (although our very own is very static).
